<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>The sharpSVN API encapsulates the whole Subversion 1.5 client api and a few of the more low-level api's. The api is designed around the Microsoft class library design guidelines and follows the common language specification (CLS). The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sharpsvn/wiki/SharpSvn">SharpSvn</a> managed code includes all subversion references, so you can just use xcopy deployment for releasing applications using this libary. </p><p>The implementation is mostly complete and a test project has been added which tests most of the api. As the Subversion 1.5 api has not been declared stable the sharpsvn api must be treated as unstable (the api can change until the initial 1.5 release of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sharpsvn/wiki/SharpSvn">SharpSvn</a>). </p><p>We are seeking for help building a more complete test set and are open for extending the api for more use-cases. </p>
