The fixed-files directory contains a slightly different version of some of
the files. These are patched to resolve incompatibilities or bugs which
are not imported in the source environment yet.

The SubversionSharp and AprSharp directories are imported directly from the
following URL's via a subversion external:

SubversionSharp http:svn.pumacode.org/repos/svndotnet/trunk/SubversionSharp/dev/src/
AprSharp        http:svn.pumacode.org/repos/svndotnet/trunk/AprSharp/dev/src/
