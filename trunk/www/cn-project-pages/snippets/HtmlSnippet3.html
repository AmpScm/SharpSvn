<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>The SharpSvn API encapsulates the whole Subversion 1.5 client api and a few of the more low-level api's. The api is designed around the Microsoft class library design guidelines and follows the common language specification (CLS). The SharpSvn managed code includes all subversion references, so you can just use xcopy deployment for releasing applications using this libary. The only external requirement is the <strong>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1</strong> runtime.</p><p>The implementation of SharpSvn is mostly complete and in use in several projects. The current api is stable, but we are adding new features over time; we don't expect any changes on the common commands, but some features might be obsoleted when better features arrive. The design of SharpSvn makes it possible to use the current release side by side&nbsp;with any future release (even in the same application).</p><p>We are seeking for help building a more complete test set, writing better documentation&nbsp;and are open for extending the api for more use-cases. </p>
