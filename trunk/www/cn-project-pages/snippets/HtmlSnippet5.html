<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>SharpSvn started as a project by Bert Huijben on Google Code. The primary user of SharpSvn is the AnkhSVN project (Subversion integration for Visual Studio). When AnkhSVN moved to openCollabNet in January 2008, SharpSvn was moved as well so that the two development communities can work in sync and grow together.&nbsp;Over the last months more and more projects are using SharpSvn to integrate Subversion support in their applications.</p><p>CollabNet hosts and supports the sharpSVN project with the goal to accelerate growth of the community and adoption by other open source and commercial&nbsp;development teams that want to integrate Subversion in their .NET environments. CollabNet also contributes code to the project. </p><p><a href="/servlets/ProjectProcess?tab=4">Get involved with SharpSvn!</a> </p>
